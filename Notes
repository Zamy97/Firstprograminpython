              ## Variables ##

* Remember variables names can contain only letter, numbers and underscores. Don't start with a number.

* Don't have any space in your variable names, however, you can use underscore in your variable names.

* Don't use python keywords and function names as your variable names.

* Keep them clear and descriptive as much as possible.

* A name error usually means  we either forgot to set a variable's value before using it, or we made a spelling mistake when entering the variable's name.

# The best way to understand new programming concepts is to try using them in your programs.
