## reading from a file

# with open('text_files/pi_digits.txt')as file_object:

# with open('Specific file route')

## Absoulate path

# Absolute paths are usually longer than relative paths, so itâ€™s helpful to store them in a variable and then pass that variable to open(). On Linux and OS X, absolute paths look like this:
# file_path = '/home/ehmatthes/other_files/text_files/filename.txt' with open(file_path) as file_object:
